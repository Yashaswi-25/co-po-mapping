CO–PO Mapping Automation System

Overview

The CO–PO Mapping Automation System is a full-stack web application designed to automate the mapping of Course Outcomes (CO) to Program Outcomes (PO) for professors. The system eliminates manual data entry, improves accuracy, and ensures that academic outcomes are properly measured and aligned with institutional and accreditation standards.

> 🏆 Patent granted (2025) for the innovation and methodology used in this system.
